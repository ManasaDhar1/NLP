Aim:

To perform basic text preprocessing using case folding, stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming in Python.

Techniques Used:

Case Folding – converts text to lowercase

Stopword Removal – removes common words (is, a, the, etc.)

Lemmatization – converts words to base form (pizzas → pizza)

Stemming – reduces words to root form (jumping → jump)

Spam Word Check – identifies spam words like win, prize, free, cash

Tools:

Python

NLTK library

Regular Expressions (re)

 Output:

The program displays:

Lemmatized text

Text after stopword removal

Stemmed words

Spam or not spam message
